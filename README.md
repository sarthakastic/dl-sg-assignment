## Design Choices

I adhered to industry-standard design principles by prioritizing reusable components and employing vanilla CSS. Embracing the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, I minimized code duplication and enhanced maintainability. This approach ensures consistent design across the project while optimizing development efficiency and scalability.
